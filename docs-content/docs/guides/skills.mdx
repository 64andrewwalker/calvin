# Skills

Calvin supports **Skills** as a directory-based asset type under `.promptpack/skills/`. A skill compiles to a platform-native `SKILL.md` folder and can include additional files (reference docs, scripts, examples).

<Callout type="warning">
Skills are supported on **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, and **Codex** only. Calvin skips skills for **VS Code** and **Antigravity** (and surfaces a warning during deploy/check when applicable).
</Callout>

## Layout

```text
.promptpack/
└── skills/
    └── <id>/
        ├── SKILL.md          # Required entrypoint (has YAML frontmatter)
        ├── reference.md      # Optional supplemental
        └── scripts/          # Optional supplemental subtree
            └── validate.py
```

- The **skill id** is the directory name (`<id>`).
- `SKILL.md` is required and must start with YAML frontmatter (`---`).
- All other files under the directory are treated as **supplementals** and are copied to outputs with the same relative paths.

## `SKILL.md` frontmatter

`SKILL.md` frontmatter uses the same YAML schema as other PromptPack assets:

- **Required**: `description`
- **Optional**: `scope`, `targets`, `allowed-tools`
- **Not supported for skills**: `apply` (Calvin errors if present)

Example:

```markdown
---
description: Draft a conventional commit message from staged changes.
kind: skill
scope: user
targets:
  - claude-code
  - codex
allowed-tools:
  - git
  - cat
---

# Instructions

1. Run `git diff --cached --stat` to summarize staged changes
2. Suggest a conventional commit message
3. If needed, consult `reference.md`
```

## Supplemental file rules (safety)

To keep skills safe and portable, Calvin enforces:

- **Text-only**: binary files are rejected (null-byte heuristic)
- **Valid UTF-8**: invalid encodings are rejected
- **No symlinks**: symlinks inside skill directories are rejected
- **Hidden files/dirs are skipped**: any `.`-prefixed path is ignored

## Output paths

Skills compile to `SKILL.md` folders on supported platforms:

| Platform | Project scope | User scope |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` | `~/.claude/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` |
| Codex | `.codex/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` | `~/.codex/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` |
| Cursor | `.claude/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` | `~/.claude/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` |

## Multi-layer semantics (override, not merge)

Skills follow Calvin’s layer precedence rules (project > additional layers > user). When the same `skills/<id>/` exists in multiple layers, the higher-priority layer **fully replaces** the lower-priority skill directory (no file-level merging).

## Commands

- `calvin deploy`: compiles skills alongside policies/actions/agents.
- `calvin deploy -v`: shows skill structure (skill + supplemental files).
- `calvin layers`: shows per-layer counts for both assets and skills.
- `calvin check`: validates deployed skill folders and warns on dangerous `allowed-tools`.
