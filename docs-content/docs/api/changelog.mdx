# API Changelog

This page highlights notable API/format milestones. For full release notes, see the repository `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Source Format (1.0)

The `.promptpack/` source format is currently **1.0** and includes:

- Required YAML frontmatter field: `description`
- Optional fields: `kind`, `scope`, `targets`, `apply`
- **Skills support**: directory-based assets under `.promptpack/skills/<id>/` with `SKILL.md` entrypoint and optional `allowed-tools` list

See [Frontmatter Spec](/api/frontmatter) for the current schema.

## Adapter Outputs

Adapters currently report `v1` in `calvin version`. These versions are informational and indicate the current stable output format family for each target.

See [Versioning Policy](/api/versioning) for current behavior and planned work.
