# API Versioning Policy

> Updated: 2025-12-27

Calvin follows **Semantic Versioning** for the CLI and crate. There are two versioning concerns:

1. **Source format version**: the `.promptpack/` schema (frontmatter + directory conventions)
2. **Adapter output version**: per-platform output formats (Claude/Cursor/VS Code/Antigravity/Codex)

## Source Format Version

The current source format version is **1.0**.

```bash
$ calvin version
Calvin v0.6.0
Source Format: 1.0
```

### Current Behavior (Honest State)

- Source format version is currently **fixed to 1.0** in the CLI output.
- A `[format]` section in `config.toml` is **reserved for future use**, but Calvin does not currently enforce a user-declared format version.

## Adapter Output Versions

`calvin version` also reports adapter output versions (currently `v1` for all adapters):

```bash
$ calvin version
Adapters:
  - ClaudeCode   v1
  - Cursor       v1
  - VSCode       v1
  - Antigravity  v1
  - Codex        v1
```

### Current Behavior (Honest State)

- Adapter versions are informational (Calvin does not currently negotiate/auto-detect IDE versions).
- IDE version detection and richer adapter version metadata are planned and tracked in `TODO.md` (TD-18).

## Migration

Calvin includes a hidden/debug `calvin migrate` command. Today it is used for **lockfile location migration** (legacy `.promptpack/.calvin.lock` → `./calvin.lock`).

Other migration dimensions (format migration, adapter migration) are reserved for future work.
