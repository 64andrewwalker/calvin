# [0-DISC] Project Analysis

> **Stage**: Discovery | **Category**: Analysis | **Frequency**: Per-project

Perform comprehensive project analysis. Create `TODO.md` to track progress.

## Tasks

1. **Structure Mapping**: Traverse all directories, identify entry points, core modules, and dependencies
2. **Architecture Analysis**: Document design patterns, data flow, and component relationships
3. **Tech Stack Inventory**: List frameworks, libraries, and tooling with versions
4. **Business Logic**: Explain what the project does and how it achieves its goals
5. **Integration Points**: Identify external services, APIs, and system boundaries

## Output

Generate `docs/analysis-report.md` containing:

- Architecture diagram (Mermaid)
- Module dependency graph
- Key design decisions and rationale
- Identified technical debt
- Recommendations for onboarding
Update `TODO.md` as you complete each section.
